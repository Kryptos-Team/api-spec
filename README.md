# What is this thing?

This document defines the REST API specification implemented by [Kryptos-Team](https://github.com/Kryptos-Team) APIs.

Our goal is to make APIs that are easy to use as possible. Each service has documentation available,
but this should be a supplement, not required reading. A user should be able to navigate through the
APIs and it's specifications without a need to go through it's documentation making the APIs
`discoverable`.

# The Specification

The full technical specification to come soon. Stay tuned!
